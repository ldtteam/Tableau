To start using tableau you will need to apply to tableau plugin and configure it for your project.
This short guide will help you set up your project.

To set up a basic Tableau environment follow the following steps:
1. Apply the Tableau bootstrap plugin to your `settings.gradle`-file.
2. Configure the Tableau plugin in each project to your needs.

If that all goes a bit fast for you, don't worry, we will guide you through the process step by step.

## Applying the Bootstrap Module
There are going to be two ways to apply the Tableau bootstrap plugin, through the plugin portal, and through the Tableau Maven repository.

:::warning
For now the project is pending approval on the Gradle Plugin Portal, so you will need to use the Tableau Maven repository.

### Using the Gradle Plugin Portal
To apply the Tableau bootstrap plugin to your project, you can use the Gradle Plugin Portal.
You need to apply the plugin to the `settings` of your project, which you can do as follows:
<Tabs groupId="gradle-code">
<TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
```groovy settings.gradle
plugins {
    // Replace the version with the latest version,
    // which you can find here: https://github.com/ldtteam/Tableau/tags
    id 'com.ldtteam.tableau.bootstrap' version '1.0.0'
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
```kotlin settings.gradle.kts
plugins {
    // Replace the version with the latest version,
    // which you can find here: https://github.com/ldtteam/Tableau/tags
    id("com.ldtteam.tableau.bootstrap") version "1.0.0"
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using the Tableau Maven Repository
If you want to use the Tableau Maven repository, you need to add the repository to your `settings.gradle` file, and then apply the plugin.
You can do this as follows:
<Tabs groupId="gradle-code">
    <TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
```groovy settings.gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url "https://ldtteam.jfrog.io/artifactory/tableau/"
        }
    }
}

plugins {
    // Replace the version with the latest version,
    // which you can find here: https://github.com/ldtteam/Tableau/tags
    id 'com.ldtteam.tableau.bootstrap' version '1.0.0'
}
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
```kotlin settings.gradle.kts
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri("https://ldtteam.jfrog.io/artifactory/tableau/")
        }
    }
}

plugins {
    // Replace the version with the latest version,
    // which you can find here: https://github.com/ldtteam/Tableau/tags
    id("com.ldtteam.tableau.bootstrap") version "1.0.0"
}
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Tableau maven is a virtual repository that contains all the Tableau modules, as well as their dependencies and transitive dependencies.
This means to develop a mod using Tableau and its modules for plugins you only need to add the Tableau Maven repository to your project.

All modules in Tableau that add a dependency to your projects, will add the relevant repositories to your project automatically, so this is likely the only repository you will need to add.

## Configuring the basics
To get started you will need to tell Tableau about the mod in your project.
To do this, you need to add the following to your `build` file:

<Tabs groupId="gradle-code">
    <TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
```groovy build.gradle
tableau {
    mod {
        // Mod information
        modid = 'modid' // Use your own modid here.
        minecraftVersion = '1.21.3' // Or any other minecraft version.
        publisher = 'SomePublisher' // Use your own name here.
        url = 'https://github.com/someorg/modid' // Use your own URL here.
    }
}
```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
```kotlin build.gradle.kts
tableau {
    mod {
        // Mod information
        modid.set("modid") // Use your own modid here.
        minecraftVersion.set("1.21.3") // Or any other minecraft version.
        publisher.set("SomePublisher") // Use your own name here.
        url.set("https://github.com/someorg/modid") // Use your own URL here.
    }
}
```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This configures the minecraft version against you want to compile your mod, the mod-id, the publisher, and the URL of the mod.
With this configuration the system will set up a NeoGradle workspace using the latest available NeoForge version for the specified Minecraft version.
It also will provide basic interpolation of this information for your mods.toml file, and other resources.

This is the basic setup for a Tableau project, and you can now start configuring your project further using the Tableau DSL.
See the relevant guides of the modules you want to use for more information on how to configure them.

_Happy modding!_
