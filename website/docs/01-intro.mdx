Tableau is a Gradle plugin that allows declarative configuration of Minecraft Modding projects.
It provides a common set of functionality for modding projects, simplifying the setup and configuration of your project by providing a set of modules that can be used to configure and manage the project's build process.

Tableau is designed to work with different modding frameworks and provide a unified way to manage your projects.
However, right now it only supports NeoGradle, but support for other modding frameworks and platforms will follow.

The basic low-level concept of Tableau is a module.
Each module in tableau provides some functionality, and might expose this functionality in a configurable way in the Tableau-DSL.
