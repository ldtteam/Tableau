Publishing your mod to CurseForge is a great way to share your mod with the world. CurseForge is a popular platform for sharing mods, and it is used by many mod developers to share their mods with the community.
Tableau has built-in support for publishing your mod to CurseForge, and this guide will show you how you can publish your mod to CurseForge using Tableau.

## Prerequisites
Before you can publish your mod to CurseForge, you need to have a CurseForge account. You can create an account on the [CurseForge website](https://www.curseforge.com/).
You will also need to create a new project on CurseForge. You can do this by going to the [CurseForge website](https://authors.curseforge.com/#/projects/create/general) and clicking on the "Minecraft" button and following the instructions.

### Finding your project id
From this project you needs its project id.
You can find this id on the project page, on the right under "About Project".
This is numeric id. For example, the project id for [Aequivaleo](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/aequivaleo) is `404450`.

### Getting your API key
To publish your mod to CurseForge, you need to have an API key.
To get this API key, go to the [CurseForge website](https://authors.curseforge.com), click on your profile in the top right, and then click on "My API Tokens".
You can also use this direct link: [CurseForge API Tokens](https://legacy.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens).

:::note
When creating a token, make sure to give it a reasonable name!
:::

:::danger
Keep your API key safe and do not share it with anyone!

## Configuring Tableau
To publish your mod to CurseForge, you need to configure Tableaus CurseForge module.
To do this edit the `build.gradle` file of your project and add the following configuration to the `tableau` block:

<Tabs groupId="gradle-code">
<TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
```groovy title="build.gradle"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        id = 123456 //Modify this to your project id
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        id.set(123456) //Modify this to your project id
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This is enough configuration of the project to get started with publishing your mod to CurseForge.

## Publishing your mod
To publish your mod to CurseForge, set the following environment variable:

- `CURSE_API_KEY` -> Your CurseForge API key

This enables the CurseForge module to authenticate with the CurseForge API.

Then run the following task: `curseforge`

:::warning
Right now Tableau does not support having multiple projects in one repository.
If this is needed please create a ticket, we can easily support this scenario.
:::

:::danger
We will never support providing the API key in the build.gradle file.
This is a security risk and should never be done.
:::

## Refining the publication
By default, Tableau will publish the mod to CurseForge with the following settings:
- Release type: `Release`
- Changelog: Read from a file called `changelog.md` in the root of the project
- Version: Read from the `version` property of the project
- Display name: Created from the project name, version and release type.

There are many different ways to customize the publication of your mod to CurseForge.
This section will show you how you can customize the publication of your mod to CurseForge.

### Configuring the release type
#### Using the DSL
To configure the release type of your mod, you can use the `releaseType` property of the CurseForge module:

<Tabs groupId="gradle-code">
<TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
```groovy title="build.gradle"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        releaseType = ReleaseType.BETA
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        releaseType.set(ReleaseType.BETA)
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example, we set the release type of the mod to `Beta`.

#### Using an environment variable
You can also configure the release type of the mod using an environment variable.
To do this, set the following environment variable:
- `CURSE_RELEASE_TYPE` -> The release type of the mod

### Support multiple minecraft versions
To support multiple minecraft versions, you can use the `additionalMinecraftVersions` property of the CurseForge module:

<Tabs groupId="gradle-code">
<TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
```groovy title="build.gradle"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        additionalMinecraftVersions = ["1.16.5", "1.17.1"]
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        additionalMinecraftVersions.set(listOf("1.16.5", "1.17.1"))
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Disabling fancy file names
By default, Tableau will use fancy file names for the uploaded files.
This means that the files in the CurseForge file list will have a fancy name, created from the project name, version and release type.
If you want to disable this, you can use the `usesFancyFileNames` property of the CurseForge module:

<Tabs groupId="gradle-code">
<TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
```groovy title="build.gradle"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        usesFancyFileNames = false
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        usesFancyFileNames.set(false)
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will disable the fancy file names for the uploaded files.
And the files in the CurseForge file list will have the normal name, which is equal to the file name of the main jar.

### Customizing the display name
If you do not want to use the project name as part of the fancy file name, you can customize the display name of the mod.
To do this, you can use the `artifactName` property of the CurseForge module:

<Tabs groupId="gradle-code">
<TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
```groovy title="build.gradle"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        artifactName = "MyMod"
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        artifactName.set("MyMod")
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
The version and release type will still be added to the display name.
:::

### Managing project relationships
If your mod has a relationship with another project you can configure these relationships.
Available relationships are:
- `embeddedLibrary` -> This project is a library that is embedded in your project. Users do not need to download this library separately.
- `incompatible` -> This project is incompatible with your project. Users should not use these projects together.
- `optionalDependency` -> This project is an optional dependency of your project. Users can use this project with your project, but it is not required.
- `requiredDependency` -> This project is a required dependency of your project. Users need to download this project separately.
- `tool` -> This project is a tool that is used by your project. Users can download this project separately.

To configure these relationships, you can use the `relationships` property of the CurseForge module:

<Tabs groupId="gradle-code">
<TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
```groovy title="build.gradle"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        relationships {
            embeddedLibrary("MyLibrary") // This project is a library that is embedded in your project
            incompatible("IncompatibleMod") // This project is incompatible with your project
            optionalDependency("OptionalMod") // This project is an optional dependency of your project
            requiredDependency("RequiredMod") // This project is a required dependency of your project
            tool("ToolMod") // This project is a tool that is used by your project
        }
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
tableau {
    curseforge {
        relationships {
            embeddedLibrary("MyLibrary") // This project is a library that is embedded in your project
            incompatible("IncompatibleMod") // This project is incompatible with your project
            optionalDependency("OptionalMod") // This project is an optional dependency of your project
            requiredDependency("RequiredMod") // This project is a required dependency of your project
            tool("ToolMod") // This project is a tool that is used by your project
        }
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
