The pages in this section describe more advanced techniques that you can use to configure Tableau and its individual modules.
Examples of these are:
- Configuring NeoGradle and NeoForge
- Adding and configuring custom source sets
- Publishing your mod to CurseForge
- Publishing your mod to a Maven repository
- Interpolate your resources

:::info
Any of the guides in this section assume that you have at least performed the [Getting started](../02-getting-started.mdx) guide and have imported your project at least once into an IDE, to validate that you set it up right.
This will not guide you through setting up Tableau and bootstrap it.
