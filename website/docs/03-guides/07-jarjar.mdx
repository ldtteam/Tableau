When you build a mod, you can include dependencies in the mod JAR file. This is useful when you want to distribute your mod as a single JAR file.

:::warning
Including dependencies is only supported in the main primary jar, we are working on a more complete publication system that supports an arbitrary combination of jars.
:::

:::note
This is an optional features and will need to be enabled
:::

:::tip
The jarjar module is mutually exclusive with the shadow module. You can only use one of them at a time.

## Enabling Jar-in-Jar
As this feature is optional, and a different distribution method can be used (like shadowing), you will need to enable it in your `settings` file:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
    ```groovy title=settings.gradle
        features {
            usesJarJar = true
        }
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin title=settings.gradle.kts
        features {
            usesJarJar.set(true)
        }
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Including dependencies
To include dependencies you have to add them to the `contained` configuration of your `main` source set in your build.gradle:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
    ```groovy title=build.gradle
    tableau {
        sourceSets {
            main {
                contained "com.google.guava:guava:30.1-jre"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin title=build.gradle.kts
    tableau {
        sourceSets {
            main {
                contained("com.google.guava:guava:30.1-jre")
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will include the Guava library in your mod JAR file as a JAR-in-JAR dependency.

:::note
We highly recommend using version ranges and version catalogs to manage your dependencies.

### Include transitive dependencies
By default, only the direct dependencies are included in the mod JAR file. If you want to include transitive dependencies, you can set the `usesNoneTransitiveJarJar` parameter to false:
<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
    ```groovy title=build.gradle
    tableau {
        jarJar {
            usesNoneTransitiveJarJar = false
        }
    }
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin title=build.gradle.kts
    tableau {
        jarJar {
            usesNoneTransitiveJarJar.set(false)
        }
    }
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will include all transitive dependencies of the direct dependencies in the mod JAR file.

### Implementation extension
By default, all dependencies added to the contained configuration are treated as `implementation` dependencies.
If you want to disable this behavior, you can set the `extendImplementation` parameter to false:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="groovy" label="Groovy">
    ```groovy title=build.gradle
    tableau {
        jarJar {
            extendImplementation = false
        }
    }
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin title=build.gradle.kts
    tableau {
        jarJar {
            extendImplementation.set(false)
        }
    ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
